## Repository organization

The content in the azure-content repository follows the organization of documentation on [Azure.Microsoft.com](http://azure.microsoft.com). This repository contains two root folders: 

### \includes

Content authors can create reusable content sections to be included into one or more articles. An include file is simple markdown (.md) file that can contain any valid markdown content including text, links, and images. All include markdown files must be contained in the *\includes* directory in the root of this repository. 

* **Media subfolders:** The *\includes* folder contains a *\media* folder, inside which are folders for the images in each include. The includes image folders are named identically to the include file, minus the *.md* file extension.
